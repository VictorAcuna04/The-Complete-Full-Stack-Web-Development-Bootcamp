<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  In my restless dreams, I see that town, Silent Hill. You promised me you'd
  take me there again someday. But you never did. Well, I'm alone there now...
  In our "special place." I'm waiting for you. Come to see me, James. I've been
  waiting for you to come to see me. I'm afraid I may be losing my mind, James.
  I don't remember much. Mostly, I remember the doctors and nurses. They scare
  me. But I'm waiting for you, James. I want you to come and see me. Please come
  and see me.

  The weight of the letter feels like paper and ash, a ghost of communication.
  The words themselves are fragile, reflecting Mary's failing health and the
  desperate, loving grasp she maintains on their shared past. You see, I'm
  dying, James. I am so happy I got to spend those years with you. We had such a
  wonderful time. But the sickness is eating me up inside. I want you to live
  for yourself, James. When I'm gone... I want you to stop hurting and start
  living again. Be gentle, James, and remember all the good times we shared.

  The final paragraph hangs heavy, a stark realization that the narrative
  established by the first lines is impossible. The paper in his hand is the
  last physical connection to her, and yet, the content remains a cruel paradox
  reflecting the main character's denial. The ink bleeds slightly on the cheap
  stationary. Though the physical body is gone, the memory of her remains the
  strongest pull to the town. You gave me happiness. I'll take all my love to
  the afterlife. Thank you, James. Goodbye.
