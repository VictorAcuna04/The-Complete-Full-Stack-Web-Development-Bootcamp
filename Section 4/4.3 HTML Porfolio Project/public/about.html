<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Victor Acuña, a Computer Science and Engineering student at UCLA with
  a passion for blending creativity and technology. I enjoy designing intuitive,
  accessible, and visually engaging web experiences - whether that’s through
  crafting clean interfaces, building full-stack projects, or experimenting with
  game development in Unity.
</p>

<p>
  I’ve worked on projects ranging from a responsive fashion web app that
  personalizes outfit recommendations to a top-down Unity game and a nonprofit
  initiative that teaches kids the basics of coding. My experiences as a
  Webmaster for MADE at UCLA and UI/UX Intern at DevX have helped me develop a
  strong eye for design and functionality.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of coding, I love binge-watching shows, watching anime, listening to
  music, and exploring coffee shops - always with a matcha latte in hand. These
  small joys keep me inspired and remind me to approach every project with
  curiosity and creativity.
