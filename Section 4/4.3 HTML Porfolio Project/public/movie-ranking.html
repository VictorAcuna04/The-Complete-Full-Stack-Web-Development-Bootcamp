<h3>Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</h3>
<p>
  I love how it perfectly bridges the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker. The mix
  of emotion, action, and tragedy makes it one of the most powerful stories in
  the Star Wars saga.

<h3>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</h3>
<p>
  It’s one of my favorites because it balances dark secrets, emotional depth,
  and character growth as the series reaches its turning point. The mystery
  around Voldemort’s past makes it especially gripping.

<h3>Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift</h3>
<p>
  I enjoy the unique setting, street racing culture, and the sense of
  independence the main character finds. The drifting scenes and soundtrack make
  it unforgettable.
