<h1>Trip to Shibuya</h1>

<p>
  Shibuya's iconic role in Jujutsu Kaisen makes it a desirable destination. The
  series uses the real-world location as the backdrop for the "Shibuya Incident
  Arc." Familiar landmarks such as the Shibuya Crossing and Shibuya Station
  become the battleground for key moments in the story. Walking through the
  streets allows fans to visualize the battles between the sorcerers and cursed
  spirits. This provides a connection between the city and the series'
  supernatural world.
